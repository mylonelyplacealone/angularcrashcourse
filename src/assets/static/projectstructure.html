<div class="inner-content"><h2>Angular 6 Project Structure</h2>
    <p>This is a crash course, so we are not going to do a deep dive into every file. All that's important for you to understand are the absolute basics.</p>
    <p>When you view the folder and file structure of your Angular 6 app, it should look something similar to this:</p>
    <pre class=" language-markup"><code class=" language-markup">&gt; e2e
    &gt; node_modules
    &gt; src
      &gt; app
        ...a bunch of files
    ...a bunch of files</code></pre>
    <p>You're going to spend most of your time working within the <strong>/src/app</strong>&nbsp;folder. This is where components and services are stored (we will get to those shortly).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the <strong>/src/</strong>&nbsp;folder itself, you will see an <em>index.html</em>&nbsp;(the apps entry point) and a <em>styles.css</em>&nbsp;file, which is where any global CSS rulesets are placed.</p>
    <p>The <strong>/src/assets</strong>&nbsp;folder is where you place any assets such as graphics.</p>
    <p>Not present right now is a <strong>/dist/</strong>&nbsp;folder, which is generated when you build the project in prod mode, which we'll do later on.</p>
