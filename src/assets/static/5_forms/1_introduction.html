<div class="inner-content"><h2>Forms</h2>
    
<p>A large category of frontend applications are very form-intensive, especially in the case of enterprise development. Many of these applications are basically just huge forms, spanning multiple tabs and dialogs and with non-trivial validation business logic.</p>

<p>Every form-intensive application has to provide answers for the following problems:</p>

<ul>
    <li>How to keep track of the global form state</li>
    <li>Know which parts of the form are valid and which are still invalid</li>
    <li>Properly displaying error messages to the user so that he knows what to do to make the form valid</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these are non-trivial tasks that are similar across applications, and as such could benefit from a framework.</p>

<p>The Angular framework provides us two alternative strategies for handling forms, and its up to us to decide what suits our project best.</p>

<p></p>Below are two types of forms we can design and use in Angular:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Template Driven Forms</li>
    <li>Reactive Forms</li>
</ul>
