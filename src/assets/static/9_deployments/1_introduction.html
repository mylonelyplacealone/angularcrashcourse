<div class="inner-content"><h2>Angular Apps Deployment</h2>

<p>When you are ready to deploy your Angular application to a remote server, you have various options for deployment.</p>

<p><strong>Simplest deployment possible</strong></p>
<p>For the simplest deployment, create a production build and copy the output directory to a web server.</p>

<p>Start with the production build:</p>

<pre class="language-markup code-panel"><code class="language-markup">$ ng build --prod --aot</code></pre>
<p><strong>--prod:</strong> This will create a production ready build and copy everything within the output folder (dist/ by default) to a folder on the server.</p>
<p><strong>--aot:</strong> The Angular Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiler converts your Angular HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code during the build phase before the browser downloads and runs that code. Compiling your application during the build process provides a faster rendering in the browser.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Configure the server to redirect requests for missing files to index.html. More information regarding this is available <a href="https://angular.io/guide/deployment#fallback">here</a></p>

<p>This is the simplest production-ready deployment of your application.</p>
