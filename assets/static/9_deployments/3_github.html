<div class="inner-content"><h2>Deploying Angular Apps with Github</h2>
<p>Another simple way to deploy your Angular app is to use GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>You need to create a GitHub account if you don't have one, and then create a repository for your project. Make a note of the user name and project name in GitHub.</p>

<p>Build your project using Github project name, with the Angular CLI command ng build and the options shown here:</p>

<pre class="language-markup code-panel"><code class="language-markup">ng build --prod --output-path docs --base-href &lt;project_name></code></pre>

<p>When the build is complete, make a copy of docs/index.html and name it docs/404.html.</p>
 
<p>Commit your changes and push.</p>

<p>On the GitHub project page, configure it to publish from the docs folder.</p>

<p>You can see your deployed page at https://&lt;user_name>.github.io/&lt;project_name>/</p>

<p>angular-cli-ghpages, a full featured package that does all this for you and has extra functionality.</p>
