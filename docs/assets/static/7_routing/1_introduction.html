<div class="inner-content"><h2>Angular Routing</h2>
<p>Angular gives you the possibility of dividing your application into several views that you can navigate between through the concept of routing.</p>
<p>Routing enables you to route the user to different components based on the url that they type on the browser, or that you direct them to through a link.</p>

<p>Angular 2 is designed in a modular fashion so that you can combine it with different libraries if that’s your desire and, hence, routing lives in a different module than @angular/core.</p>
<p>If you take a sneak peak at the package.json of our code sample you’ll be able to see that we refer to it as one of the Angular 2 packages:</p> 

<pre class="language-markup"><code class="language-markup">@angular/router</code></pre>
