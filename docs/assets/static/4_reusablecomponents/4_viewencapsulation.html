<div class="inner-content"><h2>View Encapsulation</h2>

<p>Angular is component based which means that every UI functionality is built as a component. Therefore, as component based styling is a recommended pattern, Angular is just about to make writing styles a rather enjoyable experience. We will discuss different styling techniques and how to use them, but before that, we need to understand the concept of Shadow DOM and View Encapsulation.</p>

<p><strong>Shadow DOM</strong></p>

<p>Shadow DOM basically allows group of DOM implementation to be hidden inside a single element (which is the basic idea of components) and encapsulate styles to the element.</p>

<p>In one sentence, Shadow DOM is part of the Web Components standard and enables DOM tree and style encapsulation. It basically means that Shadow DOM allows us to hide DOM logic behind other elements. Addition to that, it enables us to apply scoped styles to elements without them bleeding out to the outer world.</p>

<p>Why is that great? We can finally build components that expose a single (custom) element with hidden DOM logic under the hood, and styles that only apply to that element - a web component. Just think of an &lt;input type="date"> element. Isn’t it nice that we can just use a single tag and the browser renders a whole date picker for us? Guess with what you can achieve that…</p>

<p><strong>View Encapsulation</strong></p>
<p>View encapsulation defines whether the template and styles defined within the component can affect the whole application or vice versa. Angular provides three encapsulation strategies:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Emulated (default)</strong> - styles from main HTML propagate to the component. Styles defined in this component's @Component decorator are scoped to this component only. And all the styles are placed inside html head tag with auto generated qualifier.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Native</strong> - styles from main HTML do not propagate to the component. Styles defined in this component's @Component decorator are scoped to this component only. And all the styles are placed inside component DOM only instead of puttin it to head tag. This is great if we are defining a 3rd party component which we want people to use in isolation</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>None</strong> - styles from the component propagate back to the main HTML and therefore are visible to all components on the page.</p></li> 
</ul>
<p>Be careful with apps that have None and Emulated components in the application. All components with None encapsulation will have their styles duplicated in all components with Emulated encapsulation.</p>
